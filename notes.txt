Questions
===========

1. user
---------
* where is the hook to create the backend user?
* does not exists yet. CUrrently pre-gen admin and anonymous user token
* need to add create user code to create auth code

General
---------
where are we putting the CRUD actions?
- add is in the "+"
- delete inside object detail view?

Others
--------
- "home" link
- time reference (updated N days ago, smart time lapse)

user
-------
- timezone and locale 

general
---------
- new resources have dynamic user extra data fields
-


list
----------
- user settings
- sorting, does it work yet at API? (Jon)
- trailing links at end of org etc (members, etc)
- user detail link under user list
- user data should come from the API
- user data:
- - repositories, sources, collections (ownership vs participate)

- org
- - This is the main UI template
- - use tab to show details | collections | sources
- - sorting is not important
- - all data is public for now
- - gear/edit by owner
- - deacdtivate(delete) on the edit page
- - github uses filter for the tab concept
- - add new member (existing user) to org, users to org is many-to-many
- - Q: "owner" of a user is the creator for now
- - org has only audit fields but not versioning (created by, created on etc)
- - add new need dynamic validation, uniqueness

source
- search source not yet working
- source related text (about, Term of use)
- search by version
- tabs: details | concepts | versions
- about can be a link
- details tab, inside support edit/delete
- respect "public_vew" flag, if none do not show details, if edit allow world edit
- new: owner choice = [me, or org that I am a member of]
- new: source type: dropdown+new

Concepts
- detail view: 
- - audit history, retire(delete), add new (default to current source)
- language (system wide default)
- how to deal with multiple language content (show all for now)
- extra data editing -- support a better editing -- add just one without replace all of them


mapping
- top level resource
- but has to tied to a concept
- relationship starts with a fixed set (same as, narrower etc)
- from source has to be in our database
- but "to source" can be outside data source

- some sort of picker widget that takes drop down to find the "to source"

- class and datatype - has starter set from snomed, but allow user created values, just stored as text fields. (dropdown primed with starter set)
- update comment for versioning
- when mapping is changed for a "from source concept", the concept version is incremented

collections
- tab: details, concept reference, concept, atom feeds
- 

atom feeds
-----------
concepts / collections and sources




Questions 9/17
-----------------
Something strange about migration under users...?


allauth
-----------
- signals -- signed_up vs email_confirmed which only gives email_address, not user

forms
-------
floppyform vs crispyform vs...

aaron
------
rest_framework -- head request does not pass the query on
direct query to mongo
machine access - ssh key
purge=true for delete
find out where we are with atom feed



Internationalization
----------------------

* Remember to use \_() in model and form labels.

QUESTIONS 9/23
------------
- Source: ID -- is this unique? Unique across?
- source -- must be owned by either a org or a user?


Concept Issues
================
- can be created and owned by source+usr or source+org
- depending on 'owner type'

URL Issues
============
- is there a delete cocnept ownred by user, not just org sourced?
-
